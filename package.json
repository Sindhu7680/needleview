    "changelog": "### Added\n- Static method TimedDataBuffer.Create<T>(...) to create instances of ITimedDataBuffer<T>.\n- LiveStream, a class that manages a collection of properties that can be recorded into a clip while animating the actor in the scene.\n- LiveStreamCaptureDevice, a capture device that manages a LiveStream.\n- LiveStreamPostProcessors, a base component that post-processes the stream managed by a LiveStreamCaptureDevice.\n- CameraTrackingDevice, a base capture device for implementing camera trackers.\n- SharedVolumeProfile, a component that manages an instance of VolumeProfile shared across multiple other components.\n- DepthOfField, a component that manages the depth of field effect.\n- LensDistortionBrownConrady, a component that manages the lens distortion effect based on the Brown-Conrady distortion model.\n- Overscan, a component to add overscan to a camera. Overscan is the process of rendering a larger image than the final output resolution and then cropping the image to the desired resolution.\n\n### Changed\n- Simplified the ICurve interface.\n- CircularBuffer<T> is no longer public.\n- TimedDataSource is no longer generic.\n- Introduced ITimedDataBuffer and ITimedDataBuffer<T> interfaces that replace TimedDataBuffer<T>.\n- The protected method MocapDevice<T>.GetInterpolator() replaces the MocapDevice<T>.Interpolator public property.\n- Restored video streaming on Apple silicon.\n- The minimum required Unity Editor version is now 2022.2.17f1.\n\n### Fixed\n- Live Capture icons that were missing in Unity Editor 2023.1 are now back.\n- Improved Face Capture HDRP sample scene which was overexposed and took time to adjust lighting.\n- Make sure the FrameLines component forces gate-fit mode to \"Fill\" when the camera is not using physical camera mode.\n- The Take Recorder window was still showing the device inspector when the device was disabled.\n- Takes couldn't be loaded in a TakeRecorderTrack when other tracks had invalid playables (for example an AnimationTrack's clip with no animation clip set).\n\n### Removed\n- Removed compatibility for features that require Legacy Render Pipeline."
